# SENTENCES.YAML - Spanish Sentence Generation Practice
# =============================================================================
#
# PURPOSE:
# This file contains word/verb combinations for generating Spanish sentences.
# Each entry provides the building blocks for creating practice sentences.
#
# HOW TO USE:
# 1. For each entry, construct a Spanish sentence that:
#    - Uses the specified word (noun/adjective/etc from common.yaml)
#    - Uses the specified verb conjugated in the specified basic tense
#    - Incorporates the additional_elements in a natural way
#
# 2. IMPORTANT: Generate the Spanish sentence FIRST, then translate to English.
#    This ensures natural Spanish construction rather than literal translation.
#
# 3. The additional_elements list contains advanced grammatical constructions
#    that should be woven into the sentence. For example:
#    - "present_perfect" -> use "haber + past participle" (he comido)
#    - "deber_infinitive" -> use "deber + infinitive" (debo comer)
#    - "present_subjunctive" -> use subjunctive mood (que coma)
#
# FIELDS:
# - word: Key referencing an entry in common.yaml
# - verb: Key referencing an entry in verbs.yaml
# - tense: One of the basic tenses (present, preterite, imperfect, future)
# - additional_elements: List of advanced constructions to incorporate
# - extra_infos: Optional list of {spanish, english} pairs providing helper verb
#   conjugations needed for the additional_elements (e.g., "puedo/I can" for poder)
# - spanish: "<placeholder>" - Replace with generated Spanish sentence
# - english: "<placeholder>" - Replace with English translation
